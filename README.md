An all purpose Discord bot written in discord.py. I started this Discord bot when I was in middle school, and will update occasionally 
throughout my time at University.

Two things to note:

This bot uses asyncpg, an async wrapper for PostgreSQL. 

1. You need to create a .env file in the directory under LebronJamesBot.

You need to set two secrets:
discord_token
database_password

I recommend using PgAdmin for ease of access when using PostgreSQL.

This bot has a built in command tracker, cryptocurrency price tracker and converter (BTC, ETH, LTC), among other things.
